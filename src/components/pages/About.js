      Well-rounded Software Engineer and Web Developer. Received a certificate in Full Stack Web development from Georgia Tech. 
      Learned from the ground up, starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript before moving onto more comprehensive technologies with their 
      ease-of-life features. Always goal oriented and with focused attention to detail for all tasks. Previous fields of work include
       restaurant management, electrical, and book binding. A tireless work ethic fed by deep satisfaction in a job well done makes me a valuable member of any team. Excited to bring a myriad of fun and useful tools to the digital space that increasingly
